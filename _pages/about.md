# 👨‍🎓 About Me
<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am a Master's student in Advanced Design Informatics (MSc-21 months) at the School of Informatics, [the University of Edinburgh](https://www.ed.ac.uk/). Expected graduation in July 2024. I spent four years of my undergraduate studies at [Xi'an Jiaotong-Liverpool University](https://www.xjtlu.edu.cn/en/), advised by [Prof. Yong Yue (岳勇)](https://www.xjtlu.edu.cn/en/study/departments/academic-departments/computer-science-and-software-engineering/department-staff/academic-staff/staff/yong-yue).

I recently completed a three-month internship in AIGC research at [the State Key Laboratory of CAD&CG, Zhejiang University](http://www.cad.zju.edu.cn/english.html), advised by [Prof. Xiaogang Jin (金小刚)](). I have also interned at companies like China Mobile and China Telecom in the past. 

My research interest includes **computer vision**, **multimodal**, and **AI-generated content**. 

<!--
I have published more than 100 papers at the top international AI conferences with total <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=DhtAFkwAAAAJ'>google scholar citations <strong><span id='total_cit'>260000+</span></strong></a> 
(You can also use google scholar badge <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=DhtAFkwAAAAJ'><img src="https://img.shields.io/endpoint?url={{ url | url_encode }}&logo=Google%20Scholar&labelColor=f6f6f6&color=9cf&style=flat&label=citations"></a>).

I come from Quanzhou, Fujian, China (known as the cultural capital of East Asia). I have a passion for travel and photography (my favorite photos from my travels are shown at the bottom of the webpage). My aspiration is to use AIGC to help people generate photos of themselves with world-famous landmarks.

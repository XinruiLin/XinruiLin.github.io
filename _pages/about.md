# 👨‍🎓 About Me
<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am a Master's student in Advanced Design Informatics (MSc-21 months) at the School of Informatics, [the University of Edinburgh](https://www.ed.ac.uk/), supervised by [Prof. John Vines](https://www.designinformatics.org/person/john-vines/), expected graduation in July 2024. I spent four years of my undergraduate studies at [Xi'an Jiaotong-Liverpool University](https://www.xjtlu.edu.cn/en/), advised by [Prof. Yong Yue (岳勇)](https://www.xjtlu.edu.cn/en/study/departments/academic-departments/computer-science-and-software-engineering/department-staff/academic-staff/staff/yong-yue) and assessed by [Dr. Xiaohui Zhu (朱晓辉)](https://www.xjtlu.edu.cn/en/study/departments/school-of-advanced-technology/computer-science-and-software-engineering/department-staff/academic-staff/staff/xiaohui-zhu).

I recently completed a three-month internship in AI-generated content research at [the State Key Laboratory of CAD&CG, Zhejiang University (浙江大学CAD&CG国家级重点实验室)](http://www.cad.zju.edu.cn/english.html), advised by [Prof. Xiaogang Jin (金小刚)](https://person.zju.edu.cn/0095192). In addition, I have also interned at companies like China Mobile and China Telecom in the past. 

My research interest includes **Human-computer interaction**, **Generative AI**, **Computer Vision**, and **Multimodal**.

I come from [Quanzhou](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quanzhou), Fujian, China. I have a passion for travel and photography (my favorite photos from my travels will be shown at the bottom of the webpage). My current aspiration is to design better interaction tools between humans and generative AI.
